### My NixOS Configuration
I'm giving NixOS a try too see what all of the hype is about. So far there's been a few pain points but on the whole it's mostly been alright. As someone who often starts to get anxious when falling too deep down a configuration rabbit whole when trying to get something set up, the safety net to just be able to wipe it all clean and start over is quite appealing.
